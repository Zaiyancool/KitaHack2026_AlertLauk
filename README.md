#### Problem:
Traditional campus safety infrastructure is often fragmented and slow. When emergencies happen, navigating complex menus or descriptive forms wastes precious seconds. Furthermore, students often lack real-time guidance on which paths are safest to take after dark, leaving gaps in proactive protection.

#### The Solution:
Alert Lauk prioritizes minimalism for maximum safety. By leveraging Google AI Technologies, we’ve transformed the campus safety experience into a proactive, intelligent, and hyper-responsive system.

#### Core Features:
- The "Half-Screen" SOS: A high-visibility emergency button covering 50% of the UI for instant activation under pressure.

- AI-Powered Navigation: Users can search for destinations via an integrated map that calculates the fastest vs. safest routes based on real-time campus data.

- Intelligent Reporting: Reporting is no longer a chore. Our AI assists users in describing incidents accurately and quickly, ensuring first responders have the context they need.

- Live AI Sentinel: A chat interface integrated with the live camera feed. The AI analyzes the user's surroundings in real-time to assess potential threats and provide immediate guidance.

- Admin Command Center: An AI-driven dashboard for campus security that summarizes incident trends and identifies specific zones requiring infrastructure improvements like better lighting or increased patrols.

#### Global Impact: SDG Alignment:

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities = Making campus environments inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable through smart infrastructure.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions = Reducing violence and strengthening campus institutions through transparent, data-driven safety reporting.
